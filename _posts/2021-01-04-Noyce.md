I'm happy to announce that I became a fellow of <a href="https://ucinoyce.org/">Irvine Initiative in AI, Law, and Society</a>. This fellowship financially supports my research in software accessibility during 2021. But, more importantly, the initiative helps me and other fellows connect and bring diverse ideas into our study.
