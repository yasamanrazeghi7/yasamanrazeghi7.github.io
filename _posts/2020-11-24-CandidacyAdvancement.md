I'm happy to announce that I passed the advancement to Ph.D. candidacy exam today. I presented my latest work, submitted to <a href="https://chi2021.acm.org/">CHI 2021</a>, that I introduced a new way of testing accessibility aspects of mobile applications. This work is one of the most exciting research projects that I've ever done, and I hope to present it to a bigger audience.
